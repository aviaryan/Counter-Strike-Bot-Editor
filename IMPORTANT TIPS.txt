Avis Counter Strike Bot Creator/Editor
======================================

IMPORTANT TIPS
======================================

1.	As said in Readme file,Dont create a bot after the last bot i.e pressing Create_New_Bot button when the currently selected bot is
	the last bot in the list.
	
2.	Use SWAP option only when two items are selected.!! For that Hold Ctrl and select two items..
3.	The green colour either on (BOTS or TEMPLATES) shows currently active stuff.If BOTS is coloured as Green it means,
	a bot profile is currently loaded.
4.	With the editor you can do as much edits as needed and then at last save the file by the old shortcut Ctrl+S.
5.	When you use New file option, a default file will be loaded with few templates and bot profiles so that you can easily add and
	edit them to your needs.
6.	Please follow Point (1) seriously..
7.	Use Mission Correct tool to replace old entries of name of bots with new edited names..Note that Missioncorrect will only respond
	if you have made changes to the names of any of the bot.
8.	Use Developer Notes facility to share developer notes with all others who in future will use your bot profile.
	IMPORTANT - To view D.notes Bot Editor is required.. So feel free to distribute it with any of your mission packs.

9.	Dont name any bot with names same as that of Template. i.e if you have a Template named as Sniper,dont name
	a bot as Sniper.
10.	Hit  Alt+C  if you see Bot Editor freezing down!

11. Please follow the above mentioned guidelines (and specially Point 1) seriously!
